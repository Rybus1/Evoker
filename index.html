            Hello,
            My name is Artem and I want to discuss an issue connected to the new Drakthyr class in World of Warcraft
            Dragonflight expansion. This issue is strongly related to the brand-new charged spell mechanic. To
            illustrate what I am talking about I would use a pretty simple scheme.
        </p>
        <img class="img" src="/pic.png" alt="">
        <p>
            On the picture you may see a typical gameplay of any spellcaster class in world of warcraft. These are three
            consecutive spells, launched in a queue one after another. What Blizzard was educating us through all the
            years since classic is a so called “ABC rule” – always be casting. That means that the interval in between
            two separate spells should be as close to zero as possible. The spell queue mechanic supports this idea and
            makes it possible to mash a key bind of the next spell before the previous one finishes, removing the
            time-gap between those spells.
        </p>
        <p>
            This paradigm develops a habit of button-mashing among the warcraft players. Let me describe my typical
            behavior as I play any caster class. As the first blue spell casting animation starts, my brain comes up
            with a spell, that has to be used as next. It takes some time, but at the point marked with a striped line I
            already start mashing the key bind of a red spell. Mashing goes on along the blue spell cast and continues a
            bit during the start of the red cast (all due to the fact, that I am a human and I my brain and my hand have
            some reaction delay). As soon as I realize, that red spell has already started, I start mashing the green
            spell keybind and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, let’s imagine that we are playing Evoker and red spell in the middle is a charged spell. We do have two
            settings, offered by developers:
        </p>
        <p>
            1) To initiate charged spells by pressing and releasing the button
            2) Or by tapping the button two times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lets assume we have the first setting – pressing and releasing. In that case if I would press down the
            charged spell keybind at that moment, when I normally start mashing it – nothing would happen. And this is
            obvious, as the spell-queue window is no longer than 400ms and it opens much later.
        </p>

        <p>
            In case we are using the second setting – double tap, we would succeed in launching the charged spell, but
            it would immediately release at the first stage due to continuous button mashing, that happened after the
            launch (the one, caused by my brain-lag and hand momentum). And sometimes we don’t want to use the 1st level
            charged spell.

        <h2>There are several solutions to this issue:</h2>
        <p>
            1) Make the third setting, which would me the charged spell non-interruptible by clicking the same button.
            In this case, releasing the charged spell should happen by pressing any other spell.
        </p>
        <p>
            2) Develop two macro additions:
            a. [nocharging] and
            b. /release charged spell
            This will allow to make two macro:
            First one for the charged spell, that will never interrupt itself while mashing:
            /use [nocharging:Fire breath] Fire breath
            Second one for releasing the charged spell at desired moment:
            /release charged spell
            /cast Living flame
        </p>
        <p>
            3) Make the duration of the first segment on the charged-spell cast bar insensitive to repeated mashing of
            the same button, that launched that cast.
        </p>
        <p>
            4) Make the spell-queue listen to the currently pressed key bind of a charged spell and to put it in queue,
            even though the button was pressed down earlier than the spell queue window opened.
        </p>
        <p>
            I really hope some of these solutions may be implemented in the game, as without it Evoker gameplay
            drastically differs from a comfortable caster playstyle.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>
        <p>Have a nice day.</p>
